# What's Cookin?!
> Find, and favorite recipes, and create a shopping list for ingredients you need!

What's Cookin is a site where you can browse recipes and mark them as favorites. You can also track the ingredients in your pantry, check to see if you have enough to cook a recipe, and create a shopping list of ingredients your pantry is missing.

## Getting started

If you just want to click around within our site, this will get you started.

```zsh
clone down this project
npm install
?? HOW TO GET API
?? HOW TO OPEN SITE

```
You'll need to install both `npm` and `whats-cookin-api` in order to use the site.

### Initial Configuration

If you want to use `npm` to run our tests, run `npm test test/user-test.js` (and the rest of the test files).

## Features

What can you do here?
* Choose a recipe, click the star to add it to your favorites, and click the image to view the recipe data.
* Click `view favorites` to view your favorited recipes.
* When viewing a recipe's data, if you do not have all the ingredients in the right amounts in your pantry, you can click the button to add ingredients.
